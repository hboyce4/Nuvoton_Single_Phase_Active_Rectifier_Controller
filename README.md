Nuvoton M48x Single Phase Active Rectifier Controller (NuvoSPARC I guess?)

An attempt at implementing a power electronics controller on a cheap Cortex-M4 microcontroller instead of an expensive TI DSP.

Developpped on a NuMaker-ETM-M487 (with an M487JIDAE chip) using NuEclipse.

Protoype will most likely be an M481LIDAE.
